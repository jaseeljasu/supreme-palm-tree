# Oxygen Updater (Android App) ![][badge-ci] [![latest release][badge-latest-release]][github-ou-releases]

Skip staged rollout queues and update your OnePlus device ASAP!

## Installation

These are the two places where we publish new versions; all others should not be trusted:

- [Google Play Store][play-store] (Android App Bundles)
- [GitHub releases page][github-ou-releases] (APKs)

**We highly recommend downloading & installing the app from Google Play Store**, as it has several benefits: much smaller download sizes, auto-updates (including in-app updates), Play Protect, etc.

Note: installing via GitHub still supports auto-updates via the Play Store. Both releases are completely identical (except for format differences: AAB vs APK), since they're built on the exact same codebase & commit. Usually, we release on the Play Store first (100% rollout target), and a GitHub release follows shortly after.

## Development

| **Recommended**                    | **Alternatives**                                                                                    | Note for alternatives                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Android Studio (latest stable)][android-studio]** | Any other IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) or even a text editor (Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) | Additional tools not included with your chosen IDE/editor might need to be installed separately (ADB, SDK Manager, platforms/sources, etc.)    |
| **Android device**                 | Android emulator                                                                                    | Emulators generally perform worse than a real device, even with accelerators. Also, you won't be able to test the app's root-related features. |

The app targets API 34 (Android 14/U), with a minimum API level of 21 (Android 5/Lollipop). Make sure both SDK platforms (and optionally sources) are installed via SDK Manager.

### Setup

This app uses Google & Firebase APIs, so `app/google-services.json` needs to exist. For development purposes, you'll need to create [your own Firebase project][firebase-config].

### KeyStore

Running non-`debug` variants of the app requires two things: generating a Java KeyStore and referencing it in `keystore.properties`.
Java KeyStores can be created in Android Studio itself: <kbd>Build</kbd> → <kbd>Generate Signed Bundle / APK</kbd> → <kbd>Next</kbd> → <kbd>Create new…</kbd> (under key store path). If you're not using Android Studio, check the instructions for your specific IDE. Otherwise you'll need to create one [via CLI][java8-keytool].

Store the JKS anywhere you want, though we'd recommend keeping it in the `app` directory. This git project has been configured to ignore all JKS files, so there's no danger of accidentally committing secrets.

Once that's done, create a `keystore.properties` file in this project's root directory and fill in the fields correctly:

```properties
storePassword=<store-password>
keyPassword=<key-password>
keyAlias=<alias>
storeFile=<jks-location>
```

Note: if you saved the JKS file in the `app` directory, `storeFile` doesn't need an absolute path (it's relative to `app`)
