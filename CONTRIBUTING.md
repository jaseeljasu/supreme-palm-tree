# Contributing

## Code

Thanks for contributing to Oxygen Updater, the largest community-driven app for OnePlus devices.
To help things stay organized, there are some rules that you'll have to follow:

- Make sure your code works on an actual OnePlus device, not just the Android Emulator
- Make sure your code works when you run the app with the "release" profile. This ensures that the ProGuard minification does not break the code.
(You may need to generate a new keystore and change the password in `build.gradle` for this to work)
- Clearly indicate your changes in the commit message
- Open a PR at GitHub.

## Translations

### Requirements

- An IDE or text editor
- A GitHub account

### Updating an existing language translation

1. If you want to update an existing language, [go to our GitHub][GitHub-link]. There, you’ll notice there are a lot of folders named “values-[country codes]”. For example, “fr” = France, so that’ll be named `values-fr`. With The Netherlands this would be `values-[nl]`. Don’t know what your country’s code is? Check [this][Wikipedia-link] page.
1. Fork the repository (can be done via [here][Oxygen-Updater-repo-URL] or your IDE). Use the following naming convention, for example: `translation/Dutch`. So if the language you want to translate is Danish, use `translation/Danish` as branch name.
1. Make the changes in the correct folder: location is [app/src/main/res](app/src/main/res) and commit to the branch you just created. After you've finished translating, create a Pull Request.

### Translating a new language

1. If you want to translate a new language, go to [go to our GitHub][GitHub-link]. There, you’ll notice there are a lot of folders named “values-[country codes]”. For example, “fr” = France, so that’ll be named `values-fr`. With The Netherlands this would be `values-[nl]`. Don’t know what your country’s code is? Check [this][Wikipedia-link] page.
1. Fork the repository (via [here][Oxygen-Updater-repo-URL] or your IDE). Use the following naming convention for branches, for example: `translation/Dutch`. So if the language you want to translate is Danish, use `translation/Danish` as branch name.
1. Head to [app/src/main/res](app/src/main/res) and create a new folder with the same name convention like the other translation files, like `values-nl` for Dutch.
1. Inside the folder, create a file named `strings.xml` and paste the following content inside that file: [English strings][English-strings-XML-file]. Now, you can start translating. Commit to the branch you just created and after that, open a Pull Request.
