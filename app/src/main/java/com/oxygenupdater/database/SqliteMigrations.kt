     * (`NewsItems.db`) and submitted update files (`SubmittedUpdateFiles.db`),
     * which wasn't ideal and had a lot of boilerplate code. The new Room
     * implementation has a common database and child tables, which match the
     * backend structure.
     *
     * Additional problems with the previous implementation:
     * - `SubmittedUpdateFiles.db`
     *    - Table name was `news_item`, likely due to a copy-paste error
     *    - `id`, despite being a primary key, was marked as nullable
     *    - `date_submitted` was marked as nullable, and default value was `null`
     *
     * This migration:
     * 1. Copies all existing data over (if old databases exist)
     * 2. Deletes old databases since they won't be used after this migration completes
